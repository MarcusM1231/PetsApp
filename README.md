# Pet App
Vist a pet store and select between four diffrent pets (dog, cat, plant, and fish) to bring back to your house to take care of. 

Once you get a pet you will be able to see a list of them in your home which you can click on one to view more details about them.

Once you own a pet make sure to interact and feed it in order to keep your pet both happy and fed. Beware! If your pet is not fed in a certain about of time their hunger and happiness level will be affected! I hope you enjoy the project!

More updates coming soon!!
